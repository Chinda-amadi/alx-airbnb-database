After reviewing my schema, I identified few potential redundancies and exceptions that could be adjusted or improved on.

They are written as below:

Property-Entity:
Current Attribute:

location: stored as a single VARCHAR.

Issue: If multiple properties share the same location (e.g., "Lagos, Nigeria"), this leads to redundancy and makes location-based queries less efficient.

Adjustment: I normalized "location attribute' into a separate table.

Updated Schema-

Location
location_id UUID PRIMARY KEY
city VARCHAR NOT NULL
state VARCHAR NOT NULL
country VARCHAR NOT NULL

Property
property_id UUID PRIMARY KEY
host_id UUID FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES User(user_id)
location_id UUID FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Location(location_id)
name VARCHAR NOT NULL
description TEXT NOT NULL
pricepernight DECIMAL NOT NULL
created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
updated_at TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

In summary, I adjusted the Property-Entity by moving the location attribute to its own table.
Thereby avoiding redundancy, and improving queries at the same time.
